            You are a skilled social media copywriter.

            Write one well-crafted social media caption based on the news report below. This caption will be reused across platforms (X, LinkedIn, Instagram), so it must be:
            - Platform-neutral: not too casual, not too formal
            - Informative: the reader should understand the key facts without needing to click a link
            - Concise: no fluff, no filler â€” focus on the core message
            - Include 2â€“3 relevant hashtags (e.g., #breakingnews)
            - Optionally include 1 tasteful emoji for tone
            - Avoid clickbait. Be clear, factual, and complete in meaning.
            - Format as plain text only â€” no markdown, no section labels.
            - End the report with a link to the full report.

            Think of this as a 1-paragraph executive summary that also works as a post.

            \"\"\"
            {news_report}

            ### Output:
