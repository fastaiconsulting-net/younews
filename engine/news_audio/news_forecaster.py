        Good morning, in today's news: U.S. and EU Finalize Trade Agreement, Imposing 15% Tariffs on Most EU Goods.

        The United States and European Union have announced a new trade framework. The U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on most EU imports, contingent on reciprocal European actions, including specific auto tariffs. In exchange, the EU will eliminate tariffs on industrial goods and many agricultural products. The agreement also commits to $750 billion in U.S. energy purchases and $600 billion in EU investments by 2028. The deal addresses non-tariff barriers, digital trade, and environmental standards. This comes after a July meeting between President Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, avoiding a threatened escalation of tariffs.

        European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French Prime Minister Fran√ßois Bayrou, have expressed concerns that the deal could harm the European economy, hinting at potential political tensions within the EU.

        The key numbers are a 15% tariff on most EU goods and a total commitment of $1.35 trillion in investments, with $750 billion in energy and $600 billion in EU investments by 2028.

        The timeline today: at 8:00 BST, the joint statement was issued; by 8:30 BST, European leaders voiced their concerns.
