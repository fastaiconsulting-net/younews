**What Happened**

On August 15, 2025, the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) report revealed a stronger-than-expected increase, intensifying concerns about inflationary pressures. This development has led to a reassessment of Federal Reserve rate cut expectations, with traders now anticipating a 25 basis point reduction in September, down from previous hopes for a larger 50 basis point cut. In Asia, Japan's economy showed robust growth, with the Nikkei 225 rising by 1.2%, while China's economic data, including underwhelming retail sales and industrial production, led to a 1.2% drop in Hong Kong stocks. Brent crude oil prices hovered near a two-month low ahead of a U.S.-Russia meeting in Alaska.
