**What Happened**
- On August 14, 2025, the European Commission announced a reduction in its 2025 Eurozone growth forecast to 0.9%, down from the previous estimate of 1.3%. This adjustment is attributed to "a weakening global trade outlook and higher trade policy uncertainty," primarily stemming from recent US tariffs. Additionally, Germany, the bloc's largest economy, is now expected to experience zero growth in 2025, a significant downgrade from the earlier projection of 0.7%. EU economy chief Valdis Dombrovskis emphasized the need for decisive action to enhance the EU's competitiveness in light of these challenges.
