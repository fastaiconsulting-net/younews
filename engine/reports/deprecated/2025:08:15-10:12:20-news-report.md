**What Happened**

On August 15, 2025, the European Union and the United States concluded a trade agreement that imposes a 15% tariff on most European imports, including cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. In exchange, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy over the next three years and invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. economy. This deal aims to avert a potential trade war and stabilize transatlantic relations. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/c1737bd3-9a1f-471d-9ae3-b102d6e25625?utm_source=openai))

**Why It Matters**

- **Economic Impact**: The 15% tariff represents a significant increase from the previous average of 1.2%, potentially leading to higher consumer prices in the U.S. and reduced export earnings for Europe. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/31e52a6dda17f3b5d70475e1cd0002ca?utm_source=openai))

- **Political Reactions**: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the deal as a necessary compromise to avoid economic fallout, noting that it reduced car tariffs from 27.5% to 15%. However, French Prime Minister François Bayrou criticized the agreement as a "submission" to U.S. pressure.
