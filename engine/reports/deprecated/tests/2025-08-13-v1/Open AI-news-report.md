Users reported performance issues and the unexpected removal of previous models. The company now offers models like GPT-4.1, o3, and o4-mini, accessible via the "Show additional models" option. Plus plan subscribers can choose between GPT-4o, GPT-5, and GPT-5 Thinking, the latter with a weekly limit of 3,000 messages. GPT-4.5 remains exclusive to the Pro plan.

- A U.S. federal judge has denied Elon Musk's attempt to dismiss harassment claims filed by OpenAI. The tech company alleges Musk engaged in a prolonged campaign to damage the organization, including negative public statements, social media posts, legal actions, and a purported sham attempt to acquire OpenAI assets. The case is now scheduled for a jury trial in spring 2026.

- Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI, is backing a new startup, Merge Labs, aimed at challenging Elon Musk’s Neuralink in the brain-computer interface arena. Merge Labs, currently valued at $850 million, seeks to raise $250 million, primarily from OpenAI’s ventures team. Altman will co-found the company but won't be involved in daily operations. The venture intensifies the rivalry between Musk and Altman, who previously co-founded OpenAI but had a falling out, resulting in Musk's departure from the board in 2018.
