**What Happened**
- President Donald Trump invoked the Home Rule Act of 1973 to federalize the Washington, D.C., police force, citing a declared crime emergency. This action led to the deployment of armored personnel carriers, Border Patrol and ICE agents, and National Guard troops throughout the city. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser criticized the move as an "authoritarian push," warning of potential implications for other major cities.
