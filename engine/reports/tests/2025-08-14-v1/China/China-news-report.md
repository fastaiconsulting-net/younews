**What Happened**
- **Road King Infrastructure Defaults on Offshore Bonds**: On August 14, 2025, Road King Infrastructure, a Hong Kong-based developer, announced the suspension of $22.62 million in coupon payments on its offshore debt. This follows a missed payment due on July 12 for its 2029 bond, with the grace period expiring on August 13. The company, which has offshore debt totaling $1.51 billion, cited financial challenges amid China's ongoing property crisis.

- **Tropical Storm Podul Hits Southern China**: Tropical Storm Podul made landfall in southern China on August 14, 2025, affecting provinces including Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The storm, which weakened from a typhoon after passing over Taiwan, led to the evacuation of approximately 15,000 residents from coastal areas. Warnings were also issued for inland regions like Hunan due to flood risks. In response, Chaozhou city in Guangdong suspended classes and some government functions, while Hong Kong issued its highest rainstorm warning and halted court proceedings. No casualties were initially reported in China, but the storm had previously impacted southern Taiwan, causing one death, nearly 100 injuries, and the evacuation of 8,000 residents.

- **China and India Discuss Resuming Border Trade**: China and India are in talks to restart border trade of domestic goods after a hiatus of more than five years.

**Why It Matters**

- **Disaster Preparedness and Response**: The impact of Tropical Storm Podul highlights the challenges China faces in disaster preparedness and response, particularly in densely populated coastal regions.

- **Economic Relations**: The resumption of border trade between China and India could signal a thaw in bilateral relations, potentially leading to increased economic cooperation and stability in the region.
