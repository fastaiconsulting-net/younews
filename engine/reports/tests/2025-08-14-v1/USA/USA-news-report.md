Trump indicated his intention to press Putin for a ceasefire. ([kotaradio.com](https://www.kotaradio.com/2025/08/13/todays-headlines-08-14-25/?utm_source=openai))

- Additionally, President Trump announced plans to request Congress for a long-term extension of the National Guard's presence in Washington, D.C., aiming to address crime. The administration is intensifying law enforcement efforts in the capital, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents collaborating with local police. According to the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), total violent crime in D.C. for 2024 was down 35% from 2023, marking the lowest rate in over 30 years.
