- U.S. dollar weakens amid Fed rate-cut expectations; Bitcoin hits record high.
- Asian markets pause after recent gains; U.S.-Russia summit in focus.
- Oil prices rise on supply concerns; geopolitical tensions weigh on fundamentals.

**What Happened**
- The U.S. dollar declined, reaching a two-week low against major currencies, as traders anticipate potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The dollar index stood at 97.704, with a 7% chance of a half-point cut at the Fed's September 17 meeting. This dovish outlook follows signs of a cooling labor market and muted inflationary impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.

- Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $123,674.71, driven by expectations of Fed easing and increased institutional investment. Analysts suggest that surpassing $125,000 could push Bitcoin toward $150,000.

- Asian markets experienced mixed movements. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.3% as investors locked in profits, despite recent record highs. The Japanese yen strengthened following U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's remarks that Japan was lagging in monetary tightening. Other regional markets fluctuated: Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.2%, Shanghai ticked up 0.1%, and South Korea's Kospi dropped slightly. Australia's ASX 200 rose by 0.5%, while Taiwan's and India's markets saw minor changes. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/02e8aa1fa772ad3570249dc81f917325?utm_source=openai))

- Oil prices increased modestly due to concerns over potential geopolitical repercussions from the upcoming U.S.-Russia summit on Ukraine. Brent crude rose to $65.87 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate to $62.85. The market reacted to President Trump's threats of "severe consequences" if no progress is made during peace talks, which may include further sanctions on Russian crude purchases by countries such as China and India. Analysts noted the uncertainty around the peace talks adds a bullish risk premium, though gains were capped by weak fundamentals. Recent forecasts from the U.S. and the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted increased global oil supply through the end of 2025 and into 2026, contributing to a bearish outlook. Additionally, an unexpected 3-million-barrel rise in U.S. crude inventories further limited price gains.
