**What Happened**

On August 15, 2025, the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) report revealed a stronger-than-expected increase, intensifying inflation concerns. This development has led traders to adjust their expectations for Federal Reserve monetary policy, now anticipating a 92.1% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in September. In Asia, Japan's economy showed robust growth at a 1.0% annualized pace, potentially influencing the Bank of Japan's upcoming policy decision. Conversely, China's economic data, including underwhelming retail sales and industrial production, led to a 1.2% drop in Hong Kong stocks. Additionally, Brent crude hovered near a two-month low ahead of a U.S.-Russia meeting in Alaska, which is largely viewed as preparatory, though any ceasefire outcome could impact currency markets.
