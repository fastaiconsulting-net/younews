**What Happened**

On August 21, 2025, the United States and the European Union issued a joint statement detailing a new Framework Agreement designed to strengthen their trade and investment partnership—one of the world's largest, encompassing 44% of global GDP. The agreement includes significant commitments on tariffs and other trade rules. The U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on most European goods, including specific terms for auto tariffs based on EU legislative actions. In return, the EU will eliminate tariffs on industrial goods and many agricultural products. The pact also involves $750 billion in U.S. energy purchases and $600 billion in EU investments by 2028. Additional provisions address non-tariff barriers, digital trade, and environmental standards. This agreement follows a July meeting between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, averting a threatened 30% tariff escalation by the U.S. if no deal had been reached by August 1. The deal aims to bolster economic reindustrialization on both sides of the Atlantic. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/f49188375527cac6a4d458b49f641bab?utm_source=openai))
