**Top Lines**
- Oil prices climb to one-week highs amid geopolitical tensions and strong economic data from Japan.

**What Happened**
- On August 15, 2025, oil prices reached one-week highs, with Brent crude at $67.00 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at $64.10. This uptick was driven by investor concerns ahead of the high-stakes summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, scheduled for later today. The summit aims to address the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, with a primary focus on achieving a ceasefire. President Trump's warning of "consequences" if Russia obstructs peace efforts has heightened fears about potential supply disruptions. Additionally, Japan's better-than-expected GDP growth of 1.0% annually and 0.3% quarterly has boosted sentiment, indicating stronger oil demand. However, expectations of prolonged high U.S. interest rates—amid persistent inflation and weak job data—have limited further price gains.
